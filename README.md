# Sorting Algorithms

This project implements and benchmarks several common sorting algorithms. It is designed to compare the performance of these algorithms using a large dataset.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Insertion Sort**
3. **Merge Sort**
4. **Quick Sort**
5. **Selection Sort**

## Features

- **Random Array Generation**: Creates large arrays of random integers for sorting.
- **Performance Measurement**: Measures the execution time and, in some cases, the number of iterations for each sorting algorithm.
- **Modular Testing**: Each sorting algorithm is tested independently to evaluate its performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
